# Hello, I'm Tran Duy Luan! 👋
I'm a data science student at the University of Economics in Da Nang, Vietnam. 🎓 When I'm not studying or doing homework, you can not find me any where else 🤖. So finđ me when im touching my computer

A fun fact about me: I am a fish guy  🐟

If you ever want to chat about data science, my work, or even aquarium -.-  feel free to reach out! 
I'm always happy to make new friends and have interesting conversations. 💬
